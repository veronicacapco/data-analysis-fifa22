### Abstract
Our group analyzed player data from the video game FIFA ‘22. Each playable character in the game is given an overall score determined from evaluations of their skills and physical traits. We aimed to analyze each player’s physical traits such as height, weight, and age, to see which of these traits, if any, were prevalent in the dataset. We also investigated the correlation between the players’ skills such as shooting, passing, dribbling, and defending, and their overall wage. We found that most FIFA ‘22 characters have a height between 5’11” and 6’1”, a weight between 154 and 187 pounds, and an age between 20 and 30 years. We also found out that there is a quadratic relationship between a player’s overall score and their weekly wage.
